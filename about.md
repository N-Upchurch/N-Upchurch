## Hi there, I'm Nathan.
I'm a food-service ops manager by day, graphic designer by night at [Kom Creative](https://komcreative.com). In my spare time, I like to code, play with arduino, make music, cook vegan food, and write. This is my little self-indulgent corner of the web where I can write about anything I like. I hope that as one of the ten or so people who may stumble across my echo-chamber this year, you find something here that you enjoy reading.
