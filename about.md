# What is this place?
If you haven't guessed, my name is Nathan. I'm an operations manager for [Mojo](https://us.mojo.coffee) by day, and graphic designer by night at [Kom Creative](https://komcreative.com). In my precious, precious, spare time, I like to code, play with arduino, make music, cook vegan food, and write. This is my little self-indulgent corner of the web where I can write about anything I like, because I'm interested in a lot of things, and I'm sure that those close to me are sick of hearing about it. I hope that as one of the ten or so people who may stumble across my echo-chamber this year, you find something here that you enjoy reading.

This site is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/). It came together with the help of numerous stack overflow posters, [DuckDuckGo](https://ddg.gg) searches, and blog posts. I'm eternally grateful for all of those people who helped a novice like me construct this little corner of the internet. If you want to know how I accomplished something related to the construction of this site, feel free to browse [the repo](https://github.com/N-Upchurch/N-Upchurch.github.io), or if you get in touch, I'll do my damndest to remember what I did. 

Cheers, 

-Nathan
