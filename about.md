# What is this place?
If you haven't guessed, my name is Nathan. I'm co-owner & graphic designer at [Kom Creative](https://komcreative.com), a communications specialist at [The Chicago Network](www.thechicagonetwork.org), laser area host at [Pumping Station: One](www.pumpingstationone.org), former head of operations for [Mojo](https://us.mojo.coffee) Chicago, and I code, produce drum and bass music, play classical trombone, write, play with arduinos, and cook vegan food for fun & sustinence.

This is my little self-indulgent corner of the web where I can write about anything I like. I hope, that as one of the ten or so people who may stumble across my echo-chamber this year, you find something here that you enjoy reading.

This site is built in [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

Cheers, 

-Nathan
